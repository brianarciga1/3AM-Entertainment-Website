            <p>3AM Entertainment was created by Brian Arciga and Azael Fregoso after realizing
                that most of their ideas for stories, shows and films came while staying awake
                late at night, often until 3AM. Having been friends and collaborators
                in film-making since high school, starting a film studio felt like the natural
                next step. <b>CINEMEN</b>, the first and currently only 3AM Entertainment series,
                draws inspiration from their college years and the challenges they face while 
                pursuing their dreams making it into the film industry.
